# Contact List Application - README

## **Project Description:**

This is a simple web application that allows users to manage a contact list. Users can create, view, and edit contacts.

## Features:

Create new contacts
View a list of existing contacts
Edit existing contacts

## Technology Stack:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript (using local storage)
Running the Application:

Download or clone the project files.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Dependencies:

None

Usage:

Create a new contact:
Click the "New Contact" button.
Fill in the contact's name, email, and phone number in the form.
Click the "Create Contact" button.
View existing contacts:
Click the "View Contacts" button.
The table will display a list of all contacts.
Edit a contact:
Select the checkbox next to the contact you want to edit.
Click the "Edit Contact" button (if a single contact is selected).
Edit the contact information in the form.
Click the "Save Changes" button.
Note:

_This application uses local storage to store contact information. This means that the information will be lost if you clear your browsing data._

**In addition, did not use javascript to dynamically generate more table rows. Since this is a simple app, I hardcapped the contacts to 3 just so I can mess around with functionality.**

### Further Development:

Connect to a database for more robust storage and functionality.
Implement search, sort, and filter features.
Improve user experience with visual feedback and animations.
Delete contact functionality
